When readers pay for your articles, 50% of the revenue for the author will be transferred to your wallet.

Mixin Network is blazing fast. But it may take some time for Quill to submit the transactions, especially in a busy time. Usually you may check the balance changed within a few minutes.

For Etherum Wallet users, you may check your balance in your ETH wallet(ensure the token contract is added) or on the [MVM explorer](https://scan.mvm.dev).

If you want to withdraw your balance to other Network(like Etherum Mainnet or Bitcoin), you can use [https://mvg.finance](https://mvg.finance).

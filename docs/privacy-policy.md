## **How You Share Information Through Mirror**

Our Services allow you to share information with members of the Mirror community and the public. You should carefully consider what information you choose to share because you may not be able to delete it or control who has access to it.

**Mirror community.** When you establish an account on Mirror, you share certain information with the Mirror community on our Services. This information includes the public key of the Ethereum wallet address you use to sign up for the Services  and your posts and publication. Other information you may share includes your email address, profile picture, Ethereum Name System (“ENS”) name, Twitter account, and other information listed above in the “Personal Information We Collect” section.

**Content creators.** When you subscribe to a writer, publisher or other relevant content creator, you share your wallet address with the content creator. You may also choose to share information, such as your email address, with the content creator to enable them to send you their latest publications or to contact you outside of the Services.

**Blockchain technologies.** Our Services allow you to publish, store and mint content using blockchain technologies, such as Arweave and the InterPlanetary File System. When you use these technologies, your information will be stored by third parties and will be accessible to the public. Due to the nature of these technologies, even if you remove your information from our Services, you will not be able to delete information stored on the blockchain or control who has access to it.

## **How We Share Personal Information**

We do not sell your personal information.

We share personal information as follows:

**Service providers.** Companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Services or our business (such as hosting, analytics, customer support, email delivery, payment services, and identity verification services).

**Professional advisors.** Professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

**Authorities and others.** Law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties as we believe necessary to: (a) protect our, your, or others’ rights, privacy, safety, or property (including by making and defending legal claims); (b) enforce the [Terms of Service](https://www.notion.so/Mirror-Terms-of-Service-488a0460878a4846b9df4997a5d42742) that govern the Services; and (c) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical, or illegal activity.

**Business transferees.** Acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or negotiations for such transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Mirror or our affiliates (including, in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

**Third-party platforms.** If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform (such as by logging into Mirror by providing your API key or similar access token for the Services to a third party, or otherwise linking your account with the Services to a third party’s services), we may disclose the personal information that you authorized us to share. We do not control the third-party platforms’ use of your personal information, which is governed by that third party’s privacy policy and terms and conditions.

## **Your Choices**

We offer you choices that affect how we handle the personal information that we control. We do not control the content you choose to publish or store in the blockchain. For more information, please see the ‘How You Share Information Through Mirror’ section above.

**Update or delete.** You can directly update or correct your information that we hold on our systems, including your email address, profile picture, ENS name and Twitter account. You also have the ability to delete your personal information and your account by contacting us. Please note that even if you ask us to delete your account, certain information cannot be deleted by us, due to the nature of blockchain technology, including written content that has been posted to Arweave, media files that have been posted to the InterPlanetary File System and the ENS name you create if and when you burn a $WRITE token.

**Opt out of email notifications and updates.** You may opt out of email notifications and updates (other than transactional and other service-related communications) by following the opt out or unsubscribe instructions contained in the email we send you.

**Online tracking opt out.** There are a number of ways to limit online tracking, which we have summarized below:

- **Blocking cookies in your browser**. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
- **Using privacy plug-ins or browsers**. You can block our websites from setting cookies used for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, Ghostery, or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.

Note that because these opt out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.

**Do Not Track.** Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" or similar signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

**Additional rights to personal information.** You may also request to access your personal information, restrict our use of your personal information, or withdraw your consent, as permitted under applicable laws. To make a request, please email us at privacy@quill.im. We may ask for specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.

**Limits on your choices.** In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. If you are not satisfied with how we address your request, you may submit a complaint by contacting us at privacy@quill.im or by contacting the privacy regulator where you reside or work.

## **Other Sites and Apps**

The Services may contain links to websites and other online services operated by third parties. In addition, our content may be integrated into web pages or other online services that are not associated with us, including various blockchain infrastructure, such as Arweave and the InterPlanetary File System. We do not control websites or online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions.

## **Data Security**

We'll try our best to protect the personal information we collect. However, no security measures are failsafe and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

## **Children**

The Services are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Services from a child under 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.

## **Retention**

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We note that while we retain your personal information as described herein, anything published on blockchain technology may exist indefinitely as described in the ‘How You Share Your Information Through Mirror’ section above.

## **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the website.
